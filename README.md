# Let’s Have Lunch 

## Overview

**Let’s Have Lunch** is a simple full-stack web application developed as my final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with how the **frontend**, **backend**, and **database** work together in a full-stack system.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a small-scale, demo-level project—a "toy project" built while learning. I experimented a lot, asked many questions to GenAI, and focused on learning by doing rather than perfection.

## ✨ Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand the flow of data between frontend, backend, and database
- Practice building a full-stack web app from scratch
- Learn and apply React, Flask, and SQLite in a real-world scenario

## 📝 Project Description

**Let’s Have Lunch** is designed to help colleagues connect through casual lunch meetups.  
Users can:
- Create lunch invitations
- Browse upcoming lunch events
- Join or decline invitations
- View who’s attending

This simple concept aims to foster better communication, especially in multi-cultural and remote teams where casual bonding can be difficult.
